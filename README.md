## Replication File -- "How Social Influence Shapes Collective Intelligence in Binary Choices: Reconciling Disparate Findings with a Mathematical Model" by Vicky Yang and Levi Grenier
This repository contains the .zip replication code for the preprint "How Social Influence Shapes Collective Intelligence in Binary Choices: Reconciling Disparate Findings with a
Mathematical Model" by Vicky Chuqiao Yang and Levi Grenier.

Files contain either function definitions or create a figure. As such, filenames begin with either "Function_" or "Figure_". Function files are then followed by "ABM_" (denoting function for the agent-based, sequential model), "EXP_" (denoting functions for the reanalyzed experiments' data), or "SYNC_" (denoting functions for the synchronous model). Lastly, the function file "Functions_Yang_Social_Learners" contains the function definitions adapting the model presented in Yang et al. (2021).

The file also includes the reanalyzed data from the papers of Frey and Van de Rijt (2021), Becker et al (2022), and Mori et al (2012).
